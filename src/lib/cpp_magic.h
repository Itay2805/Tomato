 * Here's how:
 *
 * 1. The preprocessor expands the arguments to _IF casting the condition to '0'
 *    or '1'.
 * 2. The casted condition is concatencated with _IF_ giving _IF_0 or _IF_1.
 * 3. The _IF_0 and _IF_1 macros either returns the argument or doesn't (e.g.
 *    they implement the "choice selection" part of the macro).
 * 4. Note that the "true" clause is in the extra set of brackets; thus these
 *    become the arguments to _IF_0 or _IF_1 and thus a selection is made!

/**
 * Macro which checks if it has any arguments. Returns '0' if there are no
 * arguments, '1' otherwise.
 *
 * Limitation: HAS_ARGS(,1,2,3) returns 0 -- this check essentially only checks
 * that the first argument exists.
 *
 * This macro works as follows:
 *
 * 1. _END_OF_ARGUMENTS_ is concatenated with the first argument.
 * 2. If the first argument is not present then only "_END_OF_ARGUMENTS_" will
 *    remain, otherwise "_END_OF_ARGUMENTS something_here" will remain. This
 *    remaining argument can start with parentheses.
 * 3. In the former case, the _END_OF_ARGUMENTS_(0) macro expands to a
 *    0 when it is expanded. In the latter, a non-zero result remains. If the
 *    first argument started with parentheses these will mostly not contain
 *    only a single 0, but e.g a C cast or some arithmetic operation that will
 *    cause the BOOL in _END_OF_ARGUMENTS_ to be one.
 * 4. BOOL is used to force non-zero results into 1 giving the clean 0 or 1
 *    output required.
